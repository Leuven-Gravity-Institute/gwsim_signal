    ``f_lower = minimum_frequency``, and ``approximant=waveform_model``, then shifts both
    polarizations by ``tc`` in GPS seconds and converts them to GWpy.

    Args:
        tc: GPS time of coalescence (seconds); added to each series' ``start_time``.
        sampling_frequency: Sample rate in Hz for ``delta_t``.
        minimum_frequency: Low-frequency cutoff in Hz, passed to PyCBC as ``f_lower``.
        waveform_model: PyCBC time-domain approximant name (e.g. ``IMRPhenomD``).
        **kwargs: Additional arguments for ``get_td_waveform`` (masses, spins, distance,
            etc., depending on the approximant).

    Returns:

        GWpy [`TimeSeries`](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/latest/api/gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries/).

    Raises:
